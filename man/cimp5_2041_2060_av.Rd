\description{
Emsemble average of the decadal mean seafloor (bottom-most) projections based on RCP8.5 scenario of CIMP5 experiment.
}
\details{
Yearly mean projections from 2041-2060 were calculated from each of the GFDL-ESM-2G, IPSL-CM5A-MR and MPI-ESM-MR.
Decadal mean was calculated from the yearly mean and than averaged across the three models.
