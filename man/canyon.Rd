\description{
Global distribution of large submarine canyons from Harris and Whiteway (2011)
}
\details{
This dataset has compiled 5849 separate large submarine canyons in the world ocean.
}
\examples{
# VME-associated canyons
# Shelf-incising canyons or canyon heads shallower than about 1500 m
# The depth of 1500 m is an approximate limit for commercial bottom trawling
as well as the lower limit of the aragonite carbonate compensation depth in most of the world ocean (CCD).
