\description{
Emsemble average of the decadal mean seafloor (bottom-most) projections during 2041 to 2060
minus the decadal mean projections during 1951 to 2000 based on RCP8.5 scenario of CIMP5 experiment.
}
\details{
Climate change (difference of decadal mean) between the period of 1951 to 2000 and the period 2041 to 2080 were calculated
for each of the GFDL-ESM-2G, IPSL-CM5A-MR and MPI-ESM-MR. Emsemble average of climate changes was calculated across the three models.
